slepc-hs - Haskell bindings for SLEPc 
(Scalable Library for Eigenvalue Problem Computations)
Copyright (c) 2015, Marco Zocca ( zocca at marco dot gmail at com )

## Introduction

The [SLEPc](http://slepc.upv.es/) library provides a standardized interface for eigenvalue problems of various kind (linear, nonlinear, symmetric or not, real- or complex-valued), and several solvers, along with a rich option set. It is based on the [PETSc](http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) architecture that comprises distributed numerical data-structures and algorithms, which in turn is based on MPI, to support parallelized computations.
